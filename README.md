# Samovar

[Samovar](https://grjdh.github.io/samovar/ "Samovar") is a small SPA designed to give easy and convenient access to spells from D&D 5E.

App is almost completed with a few unfinished or planned functions like markdown in cards\' texts, different cards\' styles and unfinished translations and spelling errors, but otherwise it\'s fully operational and ready to use. It is hosted on Github Pages with [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages "gh-pages").

------------

I used [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/ru/ "material-ui") components to simplify my work with css (because it was not my focus here) and add simple and modern look to the app.

I also used [react-virtualized-auto-sizer](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/AutoSizer.md "react-virtualized-auto-sizer") and [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window "react-window") to solve a problem of rendering several hundreds cards simultaneously by rendering only a part of it.
